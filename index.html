    <h1>Story</h1><hr>
    <p align="justify">The story is set in a vast world covered in oceans, with countless islands and seas. The world is divided into four major seas: East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue. At the center of these seas is the Grand Line, a dangerous and mysterious sea where the most significant adventures take place.<mark>The story begins with the execution of Gol D. Roger, the Pirate King. Before his death, Roger revealed that he had hidden the greatest treasure, the "One Piece," at the end of the Grand Line. This revelation sparked the Great Pirate Era, with countless pirates setting sail in search of the One Piece, hoping to become the next Pirate King</mark>. Monkey D.Luffy, inspired by his childhood hero "Red-Haired" Shanks, dreams of becoming the Pirate King. Luffy possesses a cheerful and determined personality, and his defining trait is his rubber-like body, a result of eating the Gum-Gum Fruit, a type of Devil Fruit.</p><br/>
